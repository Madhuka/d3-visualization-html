## Project Abstract
Canadian Center for Computational Genomics (C3G) provides bioinformatics analysis and HPC services for the life science research community. They have completed more than 400 bioinformatics analysis projects. The Montreal C3G nodes are hosted at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center (MUGQIC). The Montreal node is strongly involved in the GenAP development team and had developped a robust genomic data analysis pipeline set.  GSOC project is to development a HTML dynamic matrix to represent datasets with multiple dimensions.

The International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) Data Portal can be used to view, search and download the data already released by multiple member consortia. The International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC)[2] Data Portal centralizes epigenomics datasets coming from different IHEC-associated projects, by storing the relevant metadata in a relational database system. 

Most real-world datasets have numerous dimensions mainly in bioinformatics. Beyond choosing a more complex visual representation the standard solution to this problem is to only visualize a subset of the dataset dimensions. User needs to get these extra dimensions for analysis task.  Multidimensional process groups data into two categories in two dimensional view. To navigate  easily through available datasets with multiple dimensions and enable items selection, DIG Viewer [3] has been developed, as an open-source library creating versatile HTML grids. The grid of DIGViewer allow users to navigate through datasets, using multiple metadata dimensions. DIGViewer is used to display epigenomics experiment results as it has multiple dimensions that are collected from multiple sources [4]. As such, all available datasets are displayed by cell types in rows, as said in columns.

Still it contains some limitations such as expanding and collapsing rows / columns in matrix, freezing title of the matrix while scrolling, updating grid content as data model update, filtering functions for the rows and columns, selecting partial cell content in the grid, row-based grouping brackets, exporting grid to files, important standard csv file to the grid view, querying values in row and columns and search for data in the view. The proposed solution would be an answer to all these issues.

## Biographical Information
### Student Profile
I am G P D Madhuka Udantha, an MSc by Research student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa. Currently I'm working as a research assistant at the LK Domain Registry affiliated with the University of Moratuwa. My research is about clustering web session and pattern mining. My research is sited with big data and, modeling user access patterns, visualization techniques with pattern mining. I have experiences in data matrix in multiple dimensions in web usage mining for my master research which is most similar to this project.

I graduated from the Faculty of IT, University of Moratuwa in 2011 with first class. During my undergraduate period I was involved in many software projects including a GPS/GSM based fleet management system (group project), Offline email System (final year individual project) etc.  After graduation I worked as a senior software engineer at WSO2 Lanka Pvt Ltd the opensource middleware company for nearly 3 years prior to pursuing a research career. I gathered great experience in working in opensource culture at WSO2 and gained exposure in using and developing Apache projects such as Axis2, Synapse and Tomcat. I also have a solid development background with javascript, java, j2me, OSGi, REST and web services while mainly contributing to WSO2 User Engagement Server which main graphical interface and the dashboard of the WSO2 product stack. I am main contribute jaggery, which is opensource and server side script framework. I was a speaker on wso2 con, 2014 on tutorial of â€˜Javascript Everywhere: Backend to Web and Mobile Apps in Javascript I have solid background for visualization, UX and JavaScript. I have completed GSOC 2015 successfully apache project (COMDEV-119 Zeppelin GSoC Project: add more D3 visualization [6])

I'm delighted to apply for the Montreal C3G nodes, this year as a GSOC student as I'm very interested to do project on developing the HTML dynamic matrix to represent datasets with multiple dimensions and contributing to the community.

## Schedule Conflicts
Availability for the Summer Project
I'm a full-time research student working on my research area big data and visualization techniques with pattern mining and I will be available during the whole summer for the proposed project. The work I'm involved in at LK Domain Registry is 100% aligned with my research; therefore I will not have any conflicts during the period.
